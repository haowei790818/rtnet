                             RTnet Version 0.9.0
                             ===================

What is it?
-----------
RTnet is real-time network protocol stack for RTAI (hard real-time Linux
extension). It provides a standard socket API to be used with RTAI kernel
modules and real-time user space processes.


What are the requirements?
--------------------------
- Linux kernel 2.6.x: 2.6.10 or better
  (Linux kernel 2.4.x: broken, yet unclear if it will get fixed anymore)
- RTAI/fusion 0.9 or better
  (RTAI 3.x: currently broken)
- x86, PowerPC, or ARM platform
  (other platforms are lacking up-to-date RTAI support)
- RealTek 8139, Intel 8255x (EtherExpress Pro 100), DEC 21x4x-based (tulip),
  AMD PCnet32/PCnetPCI, VIA Rhine, NatSemi DP8381x, RTL8169 network adapter,
  MPC8260 FCC, MPC8xx SCC/FEC, or MPC5200 on-chip controllers, SMSC LAN91C111
  embedded controller


How to install it?
------------------
1. Install and test a suitable RTAI version (see www.rtai.org)
2. cd to a preferred directory (e.g. /usr/src)
3. tar xvjf <PATH-TO-RTNET-ARCHIVE>/rtnet-X.X.X.tar.bz2
4. cd rtnet
5. make menuconfig (run "make help" for further information)
   Set at least the RTAI installation path and the path RTnet is to be
   installed to (called <PREFIX> from now on). You could also check other
   options if they fit your requirements. Help is available for each feature.
6. make
7. make install
   This will create the directories <PREFIX>/sbin with all configuration tools,
   <PREFIX>/modules containing all core modules, <PREFIX>/include with the
   required API header files, and <PREFIX>/etc with configuration files to be
   used with the rtnet startup script.
8. run "mknod /dev/rtnet c 10 240" on your target system to create the
   configuration interface device node.


How to test it?
---------------
1. Shutdown the network device which shall become part of the RT-network and
   remove its driver module (this also means that it must not be compiled
   into the kernel!)
2. Load required RTAI modules (fusion: rtai_hal, rtai_nucleus, rtai_rtdm)
3. Load the driver layer module rtai_rtdm (currently, this comes with RTnet,
   see <PREFIX>/modules directory)
4. Check <PREFIX>/etc/rtnet.conf and adapt at least the following parameters:
   RT_DRIVER, IPADDR, TDMA_MODE, TDMA_SLAVES.
5. Run <PREFIX>/sbin/rtnet start
6. Run rtping <remote-host> or load an application module
   (like addons/examples/round_trip_time/run)


Special notes
-------------
- When running RTnet on ARM using a 2.4 kernel, you have to add the following
  line to linux/arch/arm/kernel/armksyms.c:

  EXPORT_SYMBOL(__arch_strncpy_from_user);

  Otherwise, rtai_rtdm will refuse to load. Don't forget to recompile and
  install the modified kernel.
