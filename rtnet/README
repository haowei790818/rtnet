                             RTnet Version 0.6.2
                             ===================

What is it?
-----------
RTnet is real-time UDP/IP protocol stack for RTAI (hard real-time Linux
extension). It provides a standard socket API to be used with RTAI kernel
modules and LXRT processes, see rtnet.h header file for details.

What are the requirements?
--------------------------
- Linux kernel 2.4.x
- RTAI 24.1.x: 24.1.9 or 24.1.11-24.1.13, NEWLXRT when using user space API
  RTAI 3.x: tested on 3.0[r1|r2], LXRT when using user space API
- x86 (required for LXRT interface) or PowerPC platform. Other platforms are
  untested yet.
- RealTek 8139, Intel 8255x (EtherExpress Pro 100), DEC 21x4x-based (tulip),
  AMD PCnet32/PCnetPCI, VIA Rhine, NatSemi DP8381x network adapter, MPC8260
  FCC, or MPC8xx SCC/FEC on-chip controllers, SMSC LAN91C111 embedded
  controller

How to install it?
------------------
1. Install and test a suitable RTAI version (see www.rtai.org)
2. cd to a preferred directory (e.g. /usr/src)
3. tar xvjf <PATH-TO-RTNET-ARCHIVE>/rtnet-X.X.X.tar.bz2
4. cd rtnet
5. Run ./configure --with-rtai=<PATH-TO-RTAI> <options> [--prefix=<PREFIX>]
   <PATH-TO-RTAI> is either the configured and compiled source directory of a
   24.1.x version or the installation directory of a 3.x version. Some of the
   available options are:
       --enable-allpci          compiles all PCI NIC drivers
       --enable-8139            compiles the RealTek driver
       --enable-eepro100        compiles the EtherExpress driver
       --enable-pcnet32         compiles the PCnet32 driver
       --enable-tulip           compiles the DEC driver
       --enable-via-rhine       compiles the VIA Rhine driver
       --enable-natsemi         compiles the NatSemi driver
       --enable-fcc-enet        compiles the MPC8260 FCC driver
       --enable-scc-enet        compiles the MPC8xx SCC driver
       --enable-fec-enet        compiles the MPC8xx FEC driver
       --enable-smc91111        compiles the SMSC LAN91C111 driver
       --enable-proxy           compiles the IP protocol proxy driver (legacy)
       --enable-rtcap           enables capturing support (see README.rtcap)
       --disable-checks         does not compile internal bug checks
   <PREFIX> is the installation path prefix (see below). Default <PREFIX> is
   /usr/local/rtnet. Further parameters are shown by ./configure --help. RTnet
   can also be build out-of-tree, just run configure from a newly created
   directory.
6. make
7. make install
   This will create the directories <PREFIX>/sbin with all configuration tools,
   <PREFIX>/modules containing all core modules, and <PREFIX>/include with the
   required API header files.
8. run "mknod /dev/rtnet c 10 240" on your target system to create the
   configuration interface device node.

How to test it?
---------------
1. Shutdown the network device which shall become part of the RT-network and
   remove its driver module (this also means that it must not be compiled
   into the kernel!)
2. Load required RTAI modules (24.1.x: rtai, rtai_sched; 3.x: rtai_hal,
   rtai_ksched/rtai_lxrt, rtai_sem)
3. Copy tools/rtnet.conf to the target's /etc directories and adapt at least
   the following paramters: RTNET_PATH, RT_DRIVER, IPADDR, TDMA_MODE,
   TDMA_CLIENTS.
4. Run <RTNET_PATH>/sbin/rtnet start
5. Load application module (e.g. by using examples/round_trip_time/run)
