			RTnet Version 0.2.7

What is it?
-----------
RTnet is real-time UDP/IP protocol stack for RTAI (hard real-time Linux 
extension). It offers a standard socket API to be used with RTAI kernel 
modules and LXRT processes, see header files for details.

What are the requirements?
--------------------------
- Linux kernel 2.4.x
- RTAI 24.1.9 or better
- x86 platform (at least for LXRT extensions, kernel API _should_ work on
  other platforms, too)
- RealTek 8139, Intel EtherExpress Pro 100 or 3Com EtherLink III network
  adapter

How to install it?
------------------
1. Install and test a suitable RTAI version (see also www.rtai.org)
2. cd <RTAI-DIR> (e.g. /usr/src/rtai-24.1.9)
3. rm -r rtnet
4. rm include/rtnet.h
5. tar xvzf <PATH-TO-RTNET-ARCHIVE>/rtnet-X.X.X.tar.gz
6. Enable "Real-Time networking (rtnet)" in your RTAI configuration
7. make && make install
8. run "mknod /dev/rtnet c 10 240" on your target system

How to test it?
---------------
1. Shutdown the network device which shall become part of the RT-network and
   remove its driver module (this also means that it must not be compiled
   into the kernel!)
2. Load required RTAI modules
3. Load RTnet and NIC RT-driver module
4. Setup RT-ethernet device and solicit required MAC adresses(rtifconfig)
5. Load application module
