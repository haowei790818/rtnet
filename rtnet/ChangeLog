0.5.5
- Revised IP fragmenation/defragmentation engine
- Added packet sockets (incl. example)
- Memory allocation for rtskbs based on a Linux slab cache (again...)
- Introduced rt_socket_ioctl
  * lists IPs of available interfaces
  * reports the interface flags
- Updated PPC drivers
- Added support for VIA Rhine NICs
- Fixed LXRT interface and examples
- Fixed cross-compilation issues
- Improved socket file descriptor lookup
- Discontinued static socket interfaces
- Revised device driver layer (index-based management)
- Fixed race conditions on socket close
- Added/updated the documentation
- Added/updated examples

0.5.0
- Introduced Virtual NIC support for RTmac (allows e.g. TCP/IP tunnelling
  without any influence on real-time traffic)
- New config and make system (stand-alone compilation outside the RTAI tree
  possible)
- Improved buffer pool management (avoids memory shortages if, e.g., an
  application fails to retrieve all its incoming data on time)
- Prioritised send queues in RTmac (31 real-time priorities, 1 for non
  real-time packets)
- Bindless send (sending packets without the need to bind to a specific
  interface)
- Receive calls are now blocking by default (non-blocking selectable with
  sockopts)
- Added support for AMD PCnet32/PCnetPCI network adapters
- Added early version of a driver porting guide
- As usual: various minor bug fixes

0.2.10
- New device naming sheme, internal modification of the driver layer (fixes bug
  680211)
- Fixed loopback-rt
- New RTmac frame format
- Internal improvements of RTmac
- Added UDP fragmentation, see included README.ipfragmentation - Mathias
  Koehrer
- New header file ordering, see include/INCLUDE.policy
- Various minor bug fixes...

0.2.9
- Fixed many memory leak bugs - Hans-Peter Bock
- OpenOffice document 'structure of RTnet 0.2.8' - Hans-Peter Bock
- Fixed negative module reference count bug in RTmac - Wittawat Yamwong
- RTmac deletes the master and client task correcly now - Wittawat Yamwong

0.2.8
- enhanched round_trip_time example - Hans-Peter Bock
  * configurable send intervall
  * configurable packetsize
  * accounting of sent and received packets
  * exact roundtrip time in us
  * showtime displays minimum/maximum roundtrip time
- Added rt_ip_setsockopt() for IP_TOS
- Added experimental tulip driver - Wittawat Yamwong
- Added rtnetproxy - Mathias Koehrer

0.2.7
- added new example (rtt), another round trip time example, without
  the bug of the old one, causing equal time.
- added support for 'Latency Measurement Gadget' in rtt example
- added sending broadcasts funtionality

0.2.6:
- added ICMP protocoll (now your rtai-box replies to pings)
- fixed bug in rt_ip_route_output (outgoing packets to unknown hosts)
- beautified ARP: answering an ARP request now makes a local ARP entry
- improved performance of 3c59x-rt by removing forgotten debug outputs
- improved performance of udp layer by removing forgotten debug outputs
- added start/stop script (tools/rtnet)

0.2.5:
- added real-time driver 3c59x-rt (3Com EtherLink PCI III/XL)
- fixed synchronization in socket.c und ipv4/udp.c (it is now save to
  create rt-sockets both in RTAI task and Linux context)
- fixed cleanup-bug in routing tables

0.2.4:
- added "cards" parameter to drivers to limit the number of supported
  identical NICs (allows both RT and non-RT driver of equal type to be
  loaded at the same time)
- renaming: eepro100_rt -> eepro100-rt
