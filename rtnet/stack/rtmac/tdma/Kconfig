config RTNET_TDMA
    bool "TDMA discipline for RTmac"
    depends RTNET_RTMAC
    default y
    ---help---
    The Time Division Multiple Access discipline is the default RTmac
    protocol for Ethernet networks. It consists of a master synchronising
    the access of the slaves to the media by periodically issuing frames.
    Backup masters can be set up to take over if the primary master fails.
    TDMA also provides a global clock across all participants. The tdmacfg
    tool can be used to configure a real-time NIC to use TDMA.

    See Documenatation/README.rtmac for further details.

config RTNET_TDMA_MASTER
    bool "TDMA master support"
    depends RTNET_TDMA
    default y
    ---help---
    Enables TDMA master and backup master support for the node. This can
    be switched of to reduce the memory footprint of pure slave nodes.
