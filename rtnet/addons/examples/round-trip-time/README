****** Round Trip Time ******
The idea behind this example is time measurement of a rounding
packet. A client send one packet (with a timestamp) to server and the
server send this packet back to the client. The difference in time is
the round-trip-time.

To run, set up your RTnet network (e.g. by using "rtnet start") and type

run client <server-ip>

on the client node and

run server <client-ip>

on the server node.
