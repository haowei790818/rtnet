config RTNET_RX_FIFO_SIZE
    int "Size of central RX-FIFO"
    default 32
    ---help---
    Size of FIFO between NICs and stack manager task. Must be power
    of two! Effectively, only CONFIG_RTNET_RX_FIFO_SIZE-1 slots will
    be usable.

config RTNET_ETH_P_ALL
    bool "Support for ETH_P_ALL"
    ---help---
    Enables core support for registering listeners on all layer 3
    protocols (ETH_P_ALL). Internally this is currently realised by
    clone-copying incoming frames for those listners, future versions
    will implement buffer sharing for efficiency reasons. Use with
    care, every ETH_P_ALL-listener adds noticable overhead to the
    reception path.

config RTNET_RTWLAN
    bool "Real-Time WLAN"
    ---help---
    Enables core support for real-time wireless LAN. RT-WLAN is based
    on low-level access to 802.11-compliant adapters and is currently
    in an experimental stage.
